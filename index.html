    <center> <h1>Mind-Altering Cat Parasite May Trigger Frailty in Older People</h1></center>
    <h2>
        An infamous parasite primarily carried by cats, Toxoplasma gondii, could be responsible for increased frailty in older adults, a new study reveals 
        and with 11-15 percent of people in the US thought to have been infected by it at some point, that's a significant finding.</h2><br><br>
    <h3>
        While there wasn't an association found between T. gondii infections and frailty, among those who had been infected by T. 
        gondii, people who produced a higher number of antibodies to fight it were more likely to show signs of being frail.

        To put it another way, there are signs of a link between a more severe immune reaction to this parasite, and a greater 
        likelihood of being more frail in old age. It's not enough to prove cause and effect, but it seems there might be something going on.
        
        On the inflammaging front, those with a stronger response to T. gondii (perhaps through a more widespread infection, 
        or multiple infections) also had higher levels of certain biomarkers of inflammation, suggesting another potential link there.
        
        Considering infection rates for T. gondii rise as people get older, and that it can lie dormant and undetected in 
        a human body for several decades, the researchers say we need to be even more careful when it comes to avoiding infection..</h3>

    There are plenty of reasons to find pets endearing, and one of those is because of the attachments they form to their humans.
     Our fur babies always love to be right beside us throughout the day and hate to be left out. While this is adorable, one pet
      parent shows it can be detrimental to your work production.    
    On Sunday, September 10, cat mom and TikTok user @paquito_thecat shared an amazing discovery. In her video, this woman explained
     that her cat, Paquito, likes to try and sit on her computer while she is working to "mimic" her, and the solution is simply genius.</p>
